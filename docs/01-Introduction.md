**A Few Words from the Author** 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) has come a long way in its evolution. [Its download page](https://cran.r-project.org/) looks unchanged from many years ago. Don't be fooled by its archaic first look.  This may be something to do with how the R developer community honors its history of turning the open-source project into one of the most popular data analytic tools today. The community is extremely supportive, and there are numerous learning resources. Please don't mistake that archaic look as a sign of snobbishness, and I hope you too will appreciate it some day. Welcome to the community.      

In below, we assume that you have  [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (free IDE) installed. It will be handy to have cheat sheets for [base R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/base-r.pdf), 
[RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf), [dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf), and [ggplot2](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) as well.  

If you find this introduction too technical, please start with [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html) open-source textbook (say, up to Chapter 5). The book gave an initial inspiration to start this site. Also, more information on R is available in Section \@ref(essentials), as well as various sources listed in Section \@ref(resources).   

## Materials

The power of R grows with each addition of user-contributed R packages, or a bundle of user-developed programs. Recent developments such as [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html),  [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html), and [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
have greatly streamlined the coding for data manipulation and analysis, which is the starting point for learning R that is chosen for this site.  With this new syntax system, you will learn the basic operations of data wrangling and visualization in a very intuitive  *data operation language*. Like any language, its grammar and framework provide a particular way of understanding the world. In this case, it will influence your thinking about data.     

Following the documentation of [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html), let's start with a sample dataset of airplane departures and arrivals. The dataset contains information on about 337,000 flights departed from New York City in 2013 (source: [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0)). We load a built-in data frame by command `library(nycflights13)` where `library(package_name)` loads an R package named `package_name` in the current R *session*, or the computing environment. In the R console (i.e., the left bottom pane in RStudio), type `install.packages("nycflights13")` and hit enter. 

Generally, R packages are installed in the local computer as an as-needed basis. To install several more packages that we will use, copy the following code and execute it in your R console. 

```r
# Don't worry about understanding the code here
# "#"" symbole is used to insert comments that are helpful to humans but are ignored by R 

required_pkgs <- c("nycflights13", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "knitr", "tidyr", "broom")   
  #  creating a new object "required_pkgs" containing strings "nycflights13", "dplyr",..
  # "c()" concatenates string names here. 
  # "<-" operator assigns from the object on the right to left

new_pkgs <- required_pkgs[!(required_pkgs  %in% installed.packages())] 
  # checking whether "required_pkgs" are already installed 
  # "[]" of required_pkgs[ ] is extraction by logical TRUE or FALSE
  # "%in%" checks whether items on the left are members of the items on the right.
  # ! is a negation 

if (length(new_pkgs)) {
  install.packages(new_pkgs, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}   
```


In each R session, we load libraries. Here we load the following;

```r
suppressWarnings({
  suppressMessages({
    library(dplyr)  # for data manipulation 
    library(ggplot2)  # for figures  
    library(lubridate) # for date manipulation
    library(nycflights13)  # sample data of NYC flights
    library(knitr) # for table formatting
    library(tidyr) # for table formatting
    library(broom)  # for table formatting
  })
})
```

Let's see the data. 

```r
class(flights) # shows the class attribute
dim(flights)   # obtains dimention of rows and columns 
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
## [1] 336776     19
```
 

```r
head(flights)  # displays first seveal rows and columns 
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 19

## 2  2013     1     1      533            529         4      850

## #   time_hour <dttm>
```

`dim()` command returns the dimension of a data frame, and `head()` command returns the first several rows and columns. The `flights` dataset contains information on dates, actual departure and arrival times, scheduled departure and arrival times, carriers, origins, destinations, travel times, and distances. These variables are arranged in columns, and each row is an observation of flight.   


In R, we refer to a dataset as **data frame**, which is a *class* of R object.  The **data frame** class is more general than the **matrix** class in that it can contain variables of more than one mode (numeric, character, factor etc). In case you want an overview of data types right away, here is a [summary](http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html). 


## Arts & Carfts 

### Crafts  {-}

We will focus on six data wrangling functions in the `dplyr` package.  

* `filter()`: extracts rows (e.g., observations) of a data frame. We put logical vectors in its arguments.  

* `select()`: extracts columns (e.g., variables) of a data frame. We put column names in its arguments. 

* `arrange()`: orders rows of a data frame. We put column names in its arguments. 

* `summarise()`: collapses a data frame into summary statistics. We put **summary functions**  (e.g., statistics functions) using column names in its arguments.     

* `mutate()`: creates new variables and adds them to the existing columns. We put  **window functions** (e.g., transforming operations) using column names in its arguments.  

* `group_by()`: assigns rows into groups within a data frame. We put column names in its arguments.  

The very first argument in all these functions is a **data frame**, and by using this we can easily **pipe** a sequence of data wrangling operations through `%>%` operator. The key is to start with a data frame and then formulate a sequence of data wrangling operations in plain English, which we can translate into codes by replacing **then** in the sequence with the `%>%` operator.  Say, we want to find the average delays in departures and arrivals from New York to St. Paul-Minneapolis airport (MSP). We can construct the following sequence of instructions; take the flight data frame, apply `filter()` to extract the rows of flights to MSP, and then apply `summarise()` to calculate the mean.  


```r
flights %>%  # take data frame "flights", then
  filter(dest == "MSP") %>%  # filter rows, then  
  summarise(   
    # summarise departure and arrival delays for their means 
    # and call them mean_dep_delay and mean_arr_delay respectively
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    )    # calculate the mean, while removing NA values  
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   mean_dep_delay mean_arr_delay
##            <dbl>          <dbl>
## 1       13.32481       7.270169
```

In `summarise()`, one can use **summary functions** that takes a vector as an input and produces a scaler as an output. This includes functions like `mean()`, `sd()` (standard deviation), `quantile()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `n()` (observation count in the `dplyr` package).      

Each time we apply `%>%` operator above, we pass a modified data frame from one data operation to another through the first argument. The above code is equivalent to  

```r
summarise(   # data frame "flights" is inside filter(), which is inside summarise() 
    filter(flights, dest == "MSP"), 
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   mean_dep_delay mean_arr_delay
##            <dbl>          <dbl>
## 1       13.32481       7.270169
```

You will quickly discover that `%>%` operator makes the code much easier to read, write, and edit and how that makes you want to play with the data more.  

Let's add a few more lines to the previous example. Say, additionally we want to see the average delays by carrier and sort the results by the number of observations (e.g. flights) in descending order. 

Okay, what do we do?  We make **a sequence of data wrangling operations in plain English** and translate that into **codes** by replacing **then** with `%>%` operator. 
For example, we say, "take the data frame `flights`; **then** (`%>%`)  `filter()` to extract the rows of flights to MSP;  **then** (`%>%`) group rows by carrier; **then** (`%>%`) `summarise()` data for the number of observations and the means; **then** (`%>%`) `arrange()` the results by the observation count in descending order."   


```r
flight_stats_MSP <- flights %>%  # assign the results to an object named "flight_stats"
  filter(dest == "MSP") %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%  #  group rows by carrier 
  summarise(
    n_obs = n(),  # count number of rows 
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))  # sort by n_obs in descending order

flight_stats_MSP  # show flight_stats object
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 4
##   carrier n_obs mean_dep_delay mean_arr_delay
##     <chr> <int>          <dbl>          <dbl>
## 1      DL  2864      10.651392       4.035702

```


Carrier variable is expressed in the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) code, so let's add a column of carrier names by joining another data frame called `airlines`. In RStudio, you can find this data frame under the **Environment**  tab (in the upper right corner); switch the display option from *Global Environment* to *package:nycflights13*. To inspect the data frame, type `View(airlines)` in R console. Also, by typing `data()`  you can see a list of all datasets that are loaded with libraries. 


```r
left_join(flight_stats_MSP, airlines, by="carrier") %>%
  # left_join(a,b, by="var") joins two data frames a, b by matching rows of b to a 
  # by identifier variable "var".  
  kable(digits=2)  # kable() prints a better-looking table here
```



carrier    n_obs   mean_dep_delay   mean_arr_delay  name

UA             2            -6.00            -5.50  United Air Lines Inc.    


In the next example, we add new variables to `flights` using `mutate()`.   


```r
flights %>%
  # keep only columns named "dep_delay" and "arr_delay"
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay) %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
    gain_rank = round(percent_rank(gain), digits = 2)
      # Note: we can immediately use the "gain" variable we just defined. 
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 336,776 × 4
##    dep_delay arr_delay  gain gain_rank
##        <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl>
## 1          2        11     9      0.81
## 2          4        20    16      0.88
## 3          2        33    31      0.94
## 4         -1       -18   -17      0.22
## 5         -6       -25   -19      0.18
## 6         -4        12    16      0.88
## 7         -5        19    24      0.92
## 8         -3       -14   -11      0.37
## 9         -3        -8    -5      0.54
## 10        -2         8    10      0.82
## # ... with 336,766 more rows
```

We extracted specific columns of `flights` by `select()` and added new columns defined in `mutate()`.  `mutate()` differs from `summarise()` in that  `mutate()` adds new columns to the data frame, while `summarise()` collapses the data frame into a summary table. 


There are roughly five types of [window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) that are commonly used inside `mutate()`: (1)  **summary functions**, which are interpreted as a vector of repeated values (e.g., a column of an identical mean value) : (2)  ranking or ordering functions (e.g., `row_number()`, `min_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `cume_dist()`,`percent_rank()`, and `ntile()`): (3) offset functions, say defining a lagged variable in time series data (`lead()` and `lag()`): (4)  cumulative aggregates (e.g., `cumsum()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, `cumall()`, `cumany()`, and `cummean()`): (5) fixed-window rolling aggregates such as a windowed mean, median, etc.  To find help files for these function, for example, type `?cumsum`.  


Before moving to the graphics, let's quickly go over what a **function** is in R and how you can use a custom function inside `summarise()` or  `mutate()`. In R, we use `function()` to create a function, which has its name, input arguments separated by comma, and a body (e.g., tasks to perform and what to return as an output).    

```
your_function_name <- function(input arguments) {
                        task1
                        task2
                        .
                        .
                        .
                        output_to_return 
                      } 
```

For a function having only a single expression to execute, we can omit brackets `{ }`.

```
another_function <- function(input args) task_and_output_in_a_single_expression                    
```

Let's go through a few examples. 


```r
# generate a sequence from 1 to 10 (by the increment of 1) and name it "vec1".  
vec1 <- 1:10
vec1            
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

```r
# c() concatenates 
vec2 <- c(vec1, NA, NA)
vec2
```

```
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 NA NA
```

```r
my_mean_1 <- function(x)  mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  # Input arguments: x 
  # Output: the calculation result of mean(x, na.rm = TRUE). 
  # x is required by mean() (and implicitly assumed to be a vector of numeric values). 
  # mean() is an existing function. The "na.rm" argument of mean() is set to be TRUE.  

my_mean_1(vec1)
```

```
## [1] 5.5
```

```r
my_mean_2 <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE)  mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)   
  # Input arguments: x and na.rm (optional with the default value of TRUE) 
  # Output: the calculation result of mean(x, na.rm = na.rm).
  # The input argument "na.rm" is passed to the input argument "na.rm" of mean() 

my_mean_2(vec2)
```

```
## [1] 5.5
```

```r
my_mean_2(vec2, na.rm=FALSE)  # not removing NA returns NA for the mean calculation.  
```

```
## [1] NA
```

```r
my_zscore <- function(x, remove_na=TRUE) { 
  (x - my_mean_2(x, na.rm = remove_na))/sd(x, na.rm = remove_na)  
}
  # Inputs: x and remove_na (optional: default = TRUE)
  # Output: z-score of vector x
  # my_mean2() and sd() return scalers but are interpreted 
  # as a vector of repeated valuses that has the same length as x. 

my_zscore(vec1) %>% round(2)
```

```
##  [1] -1.49 -1.16 -0.83 -0.50 -0.17  0.17  0.50  0.83  1.16  1.49
```



Let's apply functions`my_mean_2()` and `my_zscore()` in `summarise()` and `mutate()`. 

```r
flights %>% 
  select(dep_delay) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_dep_delay = my_mean_2(dep_delay),  # using my_mean_2()  
    mean_dep_delay_na = my_mean_2(dep_delay, na.rm = FALSE)  # this returns NA
  ) %>%
  kable(digits=2)
```



 mean_dep_delay   mean_dep_delay_na
---------------  ------------------
          12.64                  NA

```r
flights_gain <- flights %>%
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay) %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
    gain_z = (gain - my_mean_2(gain))/sd(gain, na.rm=TRUE),  # using my_mean_2()  
    gain_z2 = my_zscore(gain_z)  # using my_zscore()   
  )

head(flights_gain) %>%  # show the first several rows
  kable(digits=2)
```



 dep_delay   arr_delay   gain   gain_z   gain_z2
----------  ----------  -----  -------  --------
         2          11      9     0.81      0.81
         4          20     16     1.20      1.20
         2          33     31     2.03      2.03
        -1         -18    -17    -0.63     -0.63
        -6         -25    -19    -0.74     -0.74
        -4          12     16     1.20      1.20

Creating a function spares us from writing similar codes in multiple places. Avoiding such repetitions is important for making reading and editing codes easier and reducing coding errors. 

One situation you may consider use of custom function is inside functions like `summarise_each()` and `mutate_each()`. The two functions allow for applying **summary functions** like `mean()` or `sd()` to each column in a data frame.  `summarise_each()` and `mutate_each()` work by  *calling* a function by its name. They are very easy to use when an operation is to summarize a vector into a statistics without needing to specify additional arguments, say `mean(var1)`. However, providing additional arguments into a function, say `mean(var1, na.rm=TRUE)`, becomes somewhat cumbersome in terms of its syntax. 

One approach to get around this problem is to pre-process the data frame before getting to a `summarise_each()` or `mutate_each()` section. For example, if we want to pass the argument `na.rm=TRUE` to `mean()`,  we can first filter out rows that contain missing values  (`NA`) and then apply `summarise_each()`. 


```r
flights_gain %>% 
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, gain)  %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay) & !is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  
    # filter out rows that have NA values in dep_delay or arr_deplay
  summarise_each("mean") %>%  
  kable(digits=2) 
```



 dep_delay   arr_delay    gain
----------  ----------  ------
     12.56         6.9   -5.66
 
The other approach is to use a custom function. For instance, `my_mean_2()` we defined above has default argument `na.rm=TRUE` that gets passed into `mean()`, effectively overwriting the default argument `na.rm=FALSE` of `mean()`. A custom function (as well as any standard summary function) can be called in `summarise_each()` or `mutate_each()` using `funs()`;   


```r
flights_gain %>% 
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, gain) %>%
  summarise_each(funs("my_mean_2")) %>%
    kable(digits=2)
```



 dep_delay   arr_delay    gain
----------  ----------  ------
     12.64         6.9   -5.66

Being able to use your own functions in `dplyr`-style data wrangling operations will greatly enhance your ability to quickly analyze data in R.  


### Arts  {-}

Now we will cover the basics of data visualization via the [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) package. 
The `ggplot2` syntax has three essential components for generating graphics:  **data**,  **aes**,  and **geom**. This implements the following philosophy (a quote mentioned in [ModernDive](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/4-viz.html)); 

> 
A statistical graphic is a mapping of **data** variables to **aesthetic** attributes of **geometric** objects.

While coding complex graphics via `ggplot()` may appear intimidating at first, it  boils down to the three primary components:

* **data**: a data frame e.g., the first argument in `ggplot(data, ...)`.    

* **aes**:  specifications for x-y variables, as well as variables to differentiate **geom** objects by color , shape, or size. e.g., `aes(x = var_x, y = var_y, shape = var_z)` 

* **geom**: geometric objects such as points, lines, bars, etc. e.g., `geom_point()`,  `geom_line()`,  `geom_histogram()`  
 
 
One can refine a plot figure by adding secondary components or characteristics such as: 

* stat: data transformation, overlay of statistical inferences etc. 

* scales: scaling data points etc. 

* coord: Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, mapping projections etc.

* facet: laying out multiple plot panels in a grid etc. 

In below, we will generate five common types of plots: 
**scatter-plots**, **line-graphs**, **boxplots**, **histograms**, and **barplots**. 
To provide a context, let's use these plots to investigate what may explain patterns of flight departure delays.   

First, let's consider a possibility of congestion at the airport during certain times of the day or certain seasons. We can use  **barplots** to see whether there is any obvious pattern in the flight distribution across flight origins (i.e., airports) in New York City. A barplot shows observation counts (e.g., rows) by category. 


```r
ggplot(data = flights,  # the first argument is the data frame
       mapping = aes(x = origin)) +   # the second argument is "mapping", which is aes()   
  geom_bar()  #  after "+" piping operator of ggplot(), we add geom_XXX() elements 
```

We can make the plot more informative and aesthetic. 

```r
ggplot(data = flights, 
       mapping = aes(x = origin, fill = origin)) +  # here "fill" gives bars distinct colors 
  geom_bar() +  
  facet_wrap( ~ hour)  #  "facet_wrap( ~ var)" generates a grid of plots by var 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" />

Another way to see the same information is a **histogram**. 

```r
flights %>% 
  filter(hour >= 5) %>%  # exclude hour earlier than 5 a.m.
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, fill = origin)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white") 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" />
 
While mornings and late afternoons tend to get busy, there is not much difference in the number of flights across airports. 

Let's see if there are distinct patters of departure delays over the course of a year. We do this by taking the average of departure delays for each day by flight origin and plot the data as a time series using **line-graphs**.   


```r
delay_day <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day), format="%Y %m %d")) %>%
 filter(!is.na(dep_delay))  #  exclude rows with dep_delay == NA 

delay_day %>%     # "facet_grid( var ~ .)" is similar to "facet_wrap( ~ var)" 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = dep_delay)) + geom_line() + facet_grid( origin ~ . ) 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" />

The seasonal pattern seems similar across airports, and summer months appear to be busier on average. Let's see how closely these patterns across airports are related to each other by focusing on a few summer months and overlying the line-graphs.


```r
delay_day %>% 
  filter("2013-07-01" <= date, "2013-08-31" >= date)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = dep_delay, color = origin)) + geom_line()  
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" />

We can see similar patterns of spikes across airports occurring on certain days, indicating a tendency that the three airports get busy on the same days. Would this mean that the three airports tend to be congested at the same time? 

In the previous figure, there seems to be some cyclical pattern of delays. A good place to start would be comparing delays by day of the week. Here is a function to calculate day of the week for a given date.   


```r
my_dow <- function(date) {
  # as.POSIXlt(date)[['wday']] returns integers 0, 1, 2, .. 6, for Sun, Mon, ... Sat.  
  # We extract one item from a vector (Sun, Mon, ..., Sat) by position numbered from 1 to 7. 
  dow <- as.POSIXlt(date)[['wday']] + 1
  c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")[dow]  # extract "dow"-th element    
} 
  # Input: date in the format as in "2017-01-23"
  # Output: day of week 
Sys.Date()  # Sys.Date() returns the current date 
```

```
## [1] "2017-04-08"
```

```r
my_dow(Sys.Date()) 
```

```
## [1] "Sat"
```

Now, let's take a look at the mean delay by day of the week using  **boxplots**.


```r
delay_day <- flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))  %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day), format="%Y %m %d"),  
         # date defined by as.Data() function 
         wday = my_dow(date),
         weekend = wday %in% c("Sat", "Sun")  
         # %in% operator: A %in% B returns TRUE/FALSE for whether each element of A is in B. 
  )

# show the first 10 elements of "wday" variable in "delay_day" data frame 
delay_day$wday[1:10]  
```

```
##  [1] "Tue" "Wed" "Thu" "Fri" "Sat" "Sun" "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Thu"
```

```r
delay_day$wday <- ordered(delay_day$wday, 
                         levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"))
                            # adding a sorting order (Mon, Tue, ..., Sun)   
delay_day$wday[1:10]  
```

```
##  [1] Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu
## Levels: Mon < Tue < Wed < Thu < Fri < Sat < Sun
```

```r
delay_day  %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wday, y = dep_delay, fill = weekend)) + geom_boxplot() 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" />

It appears that delays are on average longer on Thursdays and Fridays and shorter on Saturdays. This is plausible if more people are traveling on Thursdays and Fridays before the weekend, and less are traveling on Saturdays to enjoy the weekend. Are Saturdays really less busy? Let's find out.  


```r
flights_wday <- flights %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day), format="%Y %m %d"),  
         wday = ordered(my_dow(date),
                        levels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun")),
         weekend = wday %in% c("Sat", "Sun")  
  )

flights_wday %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarise( nobs = n() )
```

```
## # A tibble: 7 × 2
##    wday  nobs
##   <ord> <int>
## 1   Mon 50690
## 2   Tue 50422
## 3   Wed 50060
## 4   Thu 50219
## 5   Fri 50308
## 6   Sat 38720
## 7   Sun 46357
```

```r
flights_wday  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) + geom_bar() 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="672" />

Yes, Saturdays are less busy for the airports in terms of flight numbers.   

Could we generalize this positive relationship between the number of flights and the average delays, which we find across days of the week?  To investigate this, we can summarize the data into the average delays by date-hour and see if the busyness of a particular hour of a particular day is correlated with the mean delay. We visualize these data using a **scatter plot**.     


```r
delay_day_hr <- flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day, hour) %>%  # grouping by date-hour 
  summarise(
    n_obs = n(),
    dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
    )  %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day), format="%Y %m %d"),
         wday = my_dow(date)
  )

plot_delay <- delay_day_hr  %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = dep_delay)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1)  
    # plot of n_obs and the average dep_delay 
    # where each point represents an date-hour average
    # "alpha = 0.1"  controls the degree of transparency of points 

plot_delay 
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="672" />

Along the horizontal axis, we can see how the number of flights is distributed across date-hours.  Some days are busy, and some hours busier still. It appears that there are two clusters in the number of lights, showing very slow date-hours (e.g., less than 10 flights flying out of New York city per hour) and normal date-hours (e.g., about 50 to 70 flights per hour). We could guess that the delays in the slow hours be caused by bad weather. On the other hand, we may wonder if the excess delays in the normal hours, compared to the slow hours, are caused by congestion at the airports. To see this, let's fit a curve that captures the relationships between `n_obs` and `dep_delay`.  Our hypothesis is that the delay would become more likely and longer as the number of flights increases.     


```r
plot_delay  +
  geom_smooth()   #  geom_smooth() addes a layer of fitted curve(s) 
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam'
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" />

We cannot see any clear pattern.    How about fitting a curve by day of the week? 


```r
plot_delay  +
     # additional aes() argument for applying different colors to the day of the week
  geom_smooth(aes(color = wday), se=FALSE) 
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam'
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" />

Surprisingly, the delay does not seem to increase with the flights.  There are more delays on Thursdays and Fridays and less delays on Saturdays, but we see no evidence of congestion as a cause of delay.   

Let's take a closer look at the distribution of the delays. If it is not normally distributed, we may want to apply a transformation.  


```r
delay_day_hr %>%  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay)) + geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" />

The distribution of the average delays are greatly skewed.   
In applying a logarithmic transformation, here we have to shift the variable so that its minimum is greater than zero.


```r
# define new column called "dep_delay_shifted"
delay_day_hr$dep_delay_shifted <- delay_day_hr %>%  
  with(dep_delay - min(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE) + 1) 
    # with() function takes a data frame in the first argument and allows for 
    # referencing its variable names. 

delay_day_hr %>% 
  ungroup() %>%   # removing group_by() attribute
  select(dep_delay, dep_delay_shifted) %>%
  with(
    apply(., 2, summary)
    # apply(data, num, fun)  applies function "fun" for each item 
    # in dimension "num" (1 = cows, 2= columns) of the data frame    
    # Data referenced by "." means all variables of the dataset inside with().   
    ) %>% t() #  transpose rows and columns  
```

```
##                   Min. 1st Qu. Median  Mean 3rd Qu. Max. NA's
## dep_delay          -18   1.054  6.571 12.99   15.44  269   13
## dep_delay_shifted    1  20.050 25.570 31.99   34.44  288   13
```

Now the transformed distribution; 


```r
# Under the log of 10 transformation, the distribution looks closer to a normal distribution.
delay_day_hr %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay_shifted)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay_shifted))  +  
  scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" />

```r
# Alternatively, one can apply the natural logarithm to transform a variable. Histogram shows no difference here.    
delay_day_hr %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay_shifted)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay_shifted)) +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log") +  
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-2.png" width="672" />

The transformed distribution is much less skewed than the original. Now, let's plot the relationship between delays and flights again. 


```r
delay_day_hr  %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay_shifted), dep_delay_shifted > 5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = dep_delay_shifted)) + 
  scale_y_log10() +     # using transformation scale_y_log10() 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)  + 
  geom_smooth()  
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam'
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" />

We still do not see a pattern that busier hours have more delays.  This seems to suggest that the airports in New York City manage the fluctuating number of flights without causing congestion.  

## Huning down numbers

This section is optional but contains more examples of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` functions.  

Previously, we find that the congestion at the airports is unlikely the cause of delays. Then, what else may explain the patterns of delays? Are the airlines partly responsible?  Recall that earlier we observe that some airlines have longer delays than others for NYC-MSP flights. Let's take a look at the overall average delays by carrier.   


```r
stat_carrier <- flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(n_obs = n(),
            dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
            ) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by="carrier") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) 

stat_carrier %>% kable(digit=2)
```

There could be some differences across carriers. However, the simple average of delays across various routes, days, and hours of flights may not be a good measure to compare the carriers. For example, some carriers may serve the routes and hours that tend to have more delays. Also, given that our dataset covers only the flights from New York City, the comparison may not be  nationally representative since carriers use different airports around the country for their regional hubs. 

For our purposes, let's compare the average air time among carriers, while accounting for flight's destination and timing.  The differences in air time are not the same as the differences in delays, but they may indicate some efficiency difference among carriers. 

Let's first check how air time relates to flight distance.   

```r
flights %>% 
  filter (month == 1, day == 1, !is.na(air_time)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance, y = air_time)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05)  +  
  geom_smooth()
```

```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'
```

<img src="01-Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="672" />

`air_time` and `distance` shows a general linear relationship. We can better account for this relationship if we calculate the average air time for each flight destination from New York City.  

First, we will consider a simple approach to control for such average air time for each destination and compare the variation in air time among carriers. We can do this by fitting a linear regression model with fixed destination effects and comparing the residuals. This resembles the ANOVA for comparing the mean air times among carriers, but the fixed destination effects here difference out the average air time for each destination from the total variation.  


```r
# a copy of flights data
flights2 <- flights

# TRUE/FALSE vector showing whther air_time is not NA. 
idx0 <- flights %>% with(!is.na(air_time))  

flights2$res <- NA # prepare a column of residuals to be defined below 

flights2$res[idx0] <- flights2 %>%  # replace rows with idx0 = TRUE
  filter(!is.na(air_time)) %>% 
  with( 
   lm( air_time ~ as.factor(dest))  
        # lm() estimates a linear model. 
        # "y ~ x"" is the formula for regressing y on x. 
        # as.factor() converts "dest" to a factor (categorical) class
        # which is used as a set of dummy variables in the regression.  
   ) %>% 
  residuals()  # obtains residuals of the lm() object 

stat_res <- flights2 %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_res = mean(res, na.rm = TRUE), # mean residual by carrier 
    sd_res = sd(res, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) 

left_join(stat_carrier, stat_res, by="carrier") %>% kable(digit=2)
```

The differences in air time across carriers ("mean_res") somewhat differ from the patterns of differences in the simple averages of delays ("dep_delay" and "arr_delay"). The patterns are different between "dep_delay" and "arr_delay" for that matter. 

To some extent, it appears to make sense that the average air time is longer for low-cost carriers such as Virgin America,  Frontier Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines.  The differences across other carriers, on the other hand, are small, compared to the standard deviations. To get a sense of whether these differences have any statistical significance, let's use t-test to compare the mean residual between United Airlines and American Airlines.    

```r
# t-test comparing UA vs AA for the mean air time 
flights2 %>%
  with({
    idx_UA <- carrier == "UA"
    idx_AA <- carrier == "AA"
    t.test(res[idx_UA], res[idx_AA])
    })
```

```

## data:  res[idx_UA] and res[idx_AA]
## t = -15.722, df = 68826, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -1.741133 -1.355142
## sample estimates:
##  mean of x  mean of y 
## -0.8689523  0.6791852
```

With a large number of observations, a seemingly-small difference in the means often turn out to be a statistically significant difference. Nonetheless, statistical significance is not sufficient for being an empirically significant difference that matters in the real world. The average difference of about 1.5 minute air time per flight appears very small. 

In fact, we can do this sort of pair-wise comparisons all at once using a regression. Using carrier fixed effects in addition to destination fixed effects, we can directly compare the mean effects across carriers. We will set United Airlines to be a reference of the carrier fixed effects, so that the fixed effect for United Airlines is set to zero (i.e., omitted category), from which the fixed effects of all other airlines are estimated. 


```r
flights2$carrier <- relevel(factor(flights2$carrier), ref="UA")  
# reference level is United Airlines
flights2$carrier %>% table()
```

The "estimate" column shows the mean difference in air time with United Airlines, accounting for flight destination. The estimate tends to be more precise (i.e., smaller standard errors) for carriers with a larger number of observations. This time, we find that Virgin America, Air Tran, Frontier Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines tend to show particularly longer air times than United Airlines. 

Next, let's take a step further to account for flight timing as well. We can do this by adding fixed effects for flight dates and hours. 


```r
flights2 <- flights2 %>%
  mutate( date_id = month*100 + day )

flights2$date_id %>% unique() %>% length()
```

```

```

```r
f2 <- flights2 %>%
 with(
   lm( air_time ~  as.factor(carrier) + as.factor(dest) +
        + as.factor(date_id) + as.factor(hour) )
 )

lm_rlt2 <- clean_lm_rlt(f2)
lm_rlt2 %>% kable(digit=2)

The results are similar to the previous linear mode except that this time SkyWest Airlines shows much longer air time.  

Before wrapping up, our final model is a check for the robustness of the above results. We would like to replace the date and hour fixed effects in the previous model with date-hour fixed effects (i.e., the interaction between date and hour). We could add such fixed effects using `time_hour` variable defined above. However, that would mean adding nearly 7,000 dummy variables to our linear regression, which is computationally too intensive. 

To work around this issue, we approximate this estimation by pre-processing the dependent variable. Specifically, we calculate the average air time for each combination of `time_hour` and `dest` and define a new dependent variable by subtracting this average value from the original air time variable (i.e., the new variable is centered at zero-mean for each combination of `time_hour` and `dest`).  Then, we estimate a linear model with carrier and destination fixed effects. 


```r
## Adding time_hour fixed effects is too computationally intensive 
# f1 <- flights %>%
#  with(
#    lm( air_time  ~  as.factor(carrier) + as.factor(dest) + as.factor(time_hour))   
#  )

unique(flights2$time_hour) %>% length()  # 6,936 unique time_hour 
```

```
## [1] 6936
```

```r
flights2 <- flights2 %>% 
  group_by(dest, time_hour) %>%   
  mutate(
    air_time_centered = air_time - mean(air_time, na.rm=TRUE) 
  )

f3 <- flights2 %>%
 with(
   lm( air_time_centered  ~  as.factor(carrier) + as.factor(dest) )
 )
  
lm_rlt3 <- clean_lm_rlt(f3)
lm_rlt3 %>% kable(digit=2) # Note: standard errors, t-stat, and p-val are incorrect

The point estimates should be *approximately* close to what we would obtain if we regress `air_time` on the fixed effects of `carrier`, `dest`, and `time_hour`. However, the standard errors are not correctly displayed in the table because the centered variable has less total variation compared to the original `air_time` variable. (Correct standard errors can be obtained, for example, through a bootstrapping technique.)  

Overall, we see again a tendency that low-cost carriers like Sky West Airlines, Virgin America, Frontier Airlines, and Air Tran show particularly longer air time than United Airlines. Jet Blue Airways, another low-cost carrier, shows a less obvious difference from  United Airlines, possibly suggesting that their operation focused on the East Cost is efficient for the flights departing from New York City.  Hawaiian Airlines and Alaskan Airlines appear to be somewhat different from other carriers perhaps because they are more specialized in particular flight times and destinations compared to their rivals. In particular, the flights to Hawaii may have distinct delay patterns that are concentrated on certain date-hours of the peak vacation seasons. 

##  Reflections 

In this introduction, we have reviewed the tools of `deplyr` and `ggplot2` packages as a starting point for data analyses and visualization in R. This new generation of tools is a data exploration language as much as a set of functions to shortcut traditional data manipulation  methods in R. This language provides a very intuitive system of translating our inquiries to the data analysis in R.      

Using the flight dataset, we have also investigated flight delay patterns. We find that airport congestion is unlikely a major cause of delay in New York City.  There are small differences in the air time (e.g. less than 5 minutes) across carriers for a given destination although it remains unclear how this relates to the delay patterns.  

In fact, the concept of "delay" is complicated because it is defined in reference to the scheduled departure and arrival times, which may differ by carrier. A delay would not include the time sitting in the airplane before taking off or after landing as long as it is within the schedule. It might be more interesting to compare scheduled flight duration instead of delays or air time. (Such an analysis would involve somewhat complicated manipulations of date and time with our flight data.)  

This leads us to the final point of this exercise; an interesting data analysis requires **knowledge on the real-world process that generated the data** and **the ability to ask interesting questions**.  `deplyr` and `ggplot2` packages can let you employ a variety of data analytics tools with ease, but the ultimate power of the analysis will always rest on your knowledge and creativity.

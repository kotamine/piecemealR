# Welcome {-}

Welcome to a tutorial website for data analysis and visualization with [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This site provides a quick overview and topic-based tutorials in a piecemeal fashion. 

The site is organized based on two questions: 

* How best to quickly introduce R to new audiences and showcase its data analytics tools? 

* How best to provide tutorials for topic-based data applications with R? 


To answer the first question, Section \@ref(intro) *Introduction* demonstrates a set of modern data analysis tools in R. Sections  \@ref(essentials) describes essential concepts of R. For the second question, Section \@ref(piecemeal-top) provides topic-based tutorials. Additional resources are listed in Section \@ref(resources).   

More content will be added when the author hosts a small workshop  _"Data Exploration with R"_  at his workplace.

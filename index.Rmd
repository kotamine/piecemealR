# Welcome {#index}

Welcome to a tutorial website for data analysis and visualization with [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

Two objectives of this site are: 

  - Introducing R's modern data analytics tools (Section \@ref(intro))
  - Providing topic-based tutorials (Section \@ref(piecemeal-top))  

Additional materials include: 

  - Essential concepts for R programming (Section \@ref(essentials))
  - List of additional resources (Section \@ref(resources))

## About {-}

```

### Materials {-}
This is a practice session of [dplyr](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) and [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) using [a case study](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) related to [tidyr](https://www.r-bloggers.com/data-manipulation-with-tidyr/) package.

The case is about investigating the causes of death in Mexico that have unusual temporal patterns within a day.  The data on mortalities in 2008 have the following pattern by hour;    


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Temporal pattern of all causes of death', out.width="90%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/overall.png") 
```

Do you find anything unusual or unexpected? The figure shows several peaks within a day, indicating some increased risk of death during certain times of the day. What could generate these patterns? 

Wickham, the author, finds; 

> The causes of [unusual] death fall into three main groups: murder, drowning, and transportation related. Murder is more common at night, drowning in the afternoon, and transportation related deaths during commute times [@Wickham2014]. 

[Kota, can the caption include a couple more details? Like hour of day (hod) on the x-axis and propportion (prop) on the y-axis. Also, is the black line representing the raw data?]

```{r unusual-big, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Causes of death with unusual temporal courses. Overall hourly death rate shown in grey. Causes of death with more than 350 deaths over a year.', out.width="100%", fig.asp=.75}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/unusual-big.png") 
```


We will use two datasets: `deaths` containing the timing and coded causes of deaths and `codes` containing the lookup table for the coded causes. 

<!--
# ```{r, echo=FALSE} 
# DT::datatable(deaths08[1:200,],
#       colnames =  c("Year of Death (yod)", "Month of Death (mod)", 
#                     "Day of Death (dod)", "Hour of Death (hod)", "Cause of Death (cod)")
# )
# ```
-->

The dataset `deaths` has over 53,000 records (rows), so we use `head()` to look at the first several rows.

```{r}
# "deaths08b" is a renamed dataset with easier-to-read column names 
head(deaths08b) 
```


The dataset `codes` has 1851 records. 

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
DT::datatable(codes, 
              colnames = c("Cause of Death (cod)", "Disease")
              )
```

This table is generated by [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) and [webshot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webshot/vignettes/intro.html) packages. In the search box, you can type in key words like "bacteria", "nutrition", and "fever", as well as "assault" and "exposure" to see what items are in the data.  

We will reproduce this case study and practice using functions of `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 


### Arts & Crafts {-}

Let's recap the key ingredients of [dplyr](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) and [ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) from the introduction in Section \@ref(intro).

The six important functions in `dplyr` are:

* `filter()`: extracts rows (e.g., observations) of a data frame. We put logical vectors in its arguments.  

* `select()`: extracts columns (e.g., variables) of a data frame. We put column names in its arguments. 

* `arrange()`: orders rows of a data frame. We put column names in its arguments. 

* `summarise()`: collapses a data frame into summary statistics. We put **summary functions**  (e.g., statistics functions) using column names in its arguments.     

* `mutate()`: creates new variables and adds them to the existing columns. We put  **window functions** (e.g., transforming operations) using column names in its arguments.  

* `group_by()`: assigns rows into groups within a data frame. We put column names in its arguments.  


We use piping operator `%>%` (read as *then*) to translate a sentence of sequential instructions. For example, take dataset `deaths08`, `%>%` (*then*) group the data by month of death, and `%>%` (*then*) summarise the grouped data for the number of observations.   

```{r} 
deaths08 %>% 
  group_by(mod) %>% # mod: month of death
  summarise(nobs = n()) # n(): a dplyr funciton to count rows 
```



The graphics with `ggplot2`  consist of three components: 

* **data**: a data frame e.g., the first argument in `ggplot(data, ...)`.    

* **geom**: geometric objects such as points, lines, bars, etc. with parameters in parenthesis; e.g., `geom_point()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_histogram()`  

* **aes**:  specifications for x-y variables, as well as variables to differentiate **geom** objects by color, shape, or size. e.g., `aes(x = var_x, y = var_y, shape = var_z)` 
 

We specify **data** and **aes** in `ggplot()` and then add **geom** objects followed by `+` symbol (read as *add a layer of*);  e.g., `ggplot(data = dataset, mapping = aes(x = ...)) + geom_point()`. The order of layers added by `+` symbol is generally interchangeable. 

Combined with `%>%` operator, we can think of the code as a sentence. For example, take dataset `deaths08`, `%>%` (*then*) plot with `gglpot()` with `aes()` featuring hour of day on the x-axis, `+` (*and add a player of*) geom object `geom_histogram()`.       

```{r}
#  a histogram version of the line-graph for the total number of deaths above
deaths08 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hod)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white") 
```

```{r}  
# a summary by month of day and hour of day.
# e.g, Jan-1am, ..,Jan-12pm, Feb-1am,..., Feb-12pm, ...   
n_month_hour <- deaths08 %>%
  group_by(mod, hod) %>%
  summarise( nobs = n() )

n_month_hour %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hod, y = nobs, color = as.factor(mod))) + 
  geom_point() 
  
# "last_plot() + " allows for adding more layers to the previous plot
last_plot() + geom_line()
```
 

### Exercise {-}

Now it is your turn. The exercise is to reproduce the above results for the unusual causes of deaths. 

1. Download materials: [case study paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) and [case study data](https://github.com/kotamine/piecemealR/raw/master/tidy_case_study/tidy_case_study.RData)

2.  Set working directly: `setwd(your_directory)`

3. Load libraries: `library(dplyr)`, `library(ggplot2)`, `library(MASS)` (used for fitting data by robust regression)

* Note 1: There is a minor error in the case study where the author accidentally kept several records of data from years other than 2008. This has virtually no effect on the results, and we are seeking to produce the same results as that case study.     

* Note 2: You could look at the code in the paper for hints. However, the code is written with the functions of [plyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html) package, or the precesssor of `dplyr`. Do not load both `plyr` and `dplyr` libraries in the same R session; they do not seem to have good compatibility. Restart R if you accidentally loaded both.  

#### Part A. Display overall hourly deaths {-}

We will reproduce:

<img src="tidy_case_study/overall.png" width="100%">

Hints:

* Filter `NA` in the hour of day (hod) variable

* Use `group_by()`,  `summarise()`, `n()` to obtain death counts by group

* Use `ggplot() + geom_line()` to produce plot  

* Use `+ labs( x = "x lable", y = "y label")` for axis labels

* see help file of `scale_y_continous()` for comma (use `?function_name` for help) 



#### Part B. Count deaths per hour, per disease {-}

We will reproduce: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/table16.png") 
```
<!--
<figure>
<img src="tidy_case_study/table16.png" width="600">
</figure>
-->

Panel (a) of the table contains the frequency (i.e. the number of rows) for each combination of hour of day (hod) and cause of death (cod), supplemented by the disease description in panel (b). Panel (c) shows the proportion (prop) of each hod-cod combination in the total deaths by the cod. Panel (d) contains the frequency and proportion (freq_all and prop_all) of the deaths by hour of day.  

That is, panel (a) is the raw counts (e.g., frequency) of observations by **each pair** of hour of day (hod) and cause of death (cod), and panel (b) makes it easy to see the cause of death (cod). Panel (c) converts this frequency of *hod-cod pair* into the relative frequency within the total frequency of **cod**, so that we see at which **hour** a disproportionately large number of deaths occurs for  **cod**. Panel (d), on the other hand, presents the overall hourly death rates; if every hour has the same probablity of death, we would see prop_all $\approx$ 0.042 (i.e., 1/24). Here, we see the author's idea of identifying "unusual deaths" by comparing "prop" of each **hod-cod pairs** for the deviation from to "prop_all" (see figure \@ref(fig:unusual-big)).  


Hints for creating panels (a) 

* Use more than one variable in `group_by()` 

* Use `summarise()` with `n()` to obtain death counts by group

Hints for creating panels (b)

* Use `left_join()` to add the information from dataset `codes` 

Hints for creating panel (c)

* Use `mutate()` with `sum()` on the joined dataset 

Hints for creating panels (d) 

* Create a new data frame by using `summarise()` on the joined and mutated data frame. `summarise()` will reduce the dimension of the data frame to its summmary, which is the basis of panel (d). Once the desired summary is created, merge it to the data frame of panels (a)-(c).

* Before using `summarise()` above, use `group_by()` to specify new grouping

* First create `freq_all` variable via `summarise()` with `n()` and then create `prop_all` variable via `mutate()` with `sum()` (call this data frame `overall_freq`, which will be used again at the very end)  

* Use `left_join()` to join panels (a)-(c) and panel (d) (`overall_freq`), which we refer to as `master_hod` data frame.  

Hints for extracting the same rows as in the Table 16 above 

* Create a subset of the `master_hod` data under a new name 

* Use `filter()` to select  `cod` being either  "I21", "N18", "E84", or "B16" and `hod` being greater or equal to 8 and smaller or less than 11

* Use `select()` to pick columns in a desired order and `arrange()` to sort


#### Part C. Find outliers {-}

We will reproduce: 


<img src="tidy_case_study/n-dist-raw.png" width="50%" align="left">
<img src="tidy_case_study/n-dist-log.png" width="50%" align="left">

<!--
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/n-dist-raw.png")
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/n-dist-log.png")
```
-->

We will create a deviation variable named `dist` by taking the mean of squared differences between `prop` and `prop_all`. The above figures show the the number of observations `n` and this distance measure `dist` by cause of death in the raw scale (left) and in the log scale (right).     

Hints

* Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` on the `master_hod` data frame to generate `n` with function `sum()` and `dist` by `mean((prop - prop_all)^2)`

* Filter this summary for `n > 50` and call it `devi_cod` (deviations by cause of death)

* Use `ggplot() + geom_point()` with  `data = devi_cod` to produce the raw-scale figure 

* Additionally use `scale_x_log10()`, `scale_y_log10()`, and `geom_smooth(method = "rlm", se = FALSE)` to produce the log-scale figure 

* See help for `scale_x_log10()` to adjust axis labels (look for "comma")

* Technically speaking, we should change the axis labels to indicate the logarithmic transformation, but we skip it here.  

* Let's not worry about  reproducing the exact grids as they appear in the paper



#### Part D. Fit data by a regression and plot residuals {-}

We will reproduce:

<!--
<figure>
<img src="tidy_case_study/n-dist-resid.png" width="500">
</figure>
--> 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/n-dist-resid.png")
```

The figure is a plot of the regression residuals `resid` of `log(dist)` on `log(n)`. By visual inspection, the points lying above the holizontal line at `resid=1.5` are considered to be "unusual causes of deaths" by the author.

Here the author used the robust linear model (`rlm()`) regression, but the syntax is mostly the same as that of the standard linear model regression (`lm()` ).  

Here is an example of regression by `lm()`. 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x1 <-  c(1:10),
  y1 <-  c(1,3,2,4,6,5,7,5,7,8)
)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

The `geom_smooth()` is estimating the following linear regression:
$$ y1 = intercept + coefficient * x1 + residual$$
The model is estimated by `lm()` as follows; 

```{r}
f1 <- lm(formula = y1 ~ x1,  data = df) 
```

Now let's see what we get out of the estimation results `f1`. 

```{r}
class(f1)    # class "lm"
summary(f1)  # summary() knows how to summarise an object of class "lm" 
coefficients(f1)  # coefficient point estimate
vcov(f1)          # coefficient variance-covariance matrix
predict(f1)       # predicted (fitted) values with the estimated coefficients 
resid(f1)         # residuals:  
```

Now let's get back to our exercise and reproduce the figure above. 

Hints 

* Run a regression by `rlm` with `formula = log(dist) ~ log(n)` and store the residuals in `devi_cod` data. To read more about linear regressions, see the help file of `lm()` (type `?lm`).  For adding a column of residuals, you can use assignment `devi_cod$resid <- your_residuals`.  

* Plot the residual against log-scale `n` 

* Note: Check the dataset `devi_cod` for missing values of `dist` and `n` before running a regression (you should not have missing values in this case).  Most regression functions, including `lm()` and `rlm()`, drop any row with missing values from the estimation. This becomes an issue if we want to add a new column containing predicted values or residuals to the original dataset. (When rows containing missing values are dropped, the vector generated by `predict()` or  `resid()` will be shorter than the number of rows in the original dataset.)      

* Use `ggplot() + geom_point()` structure for the plot

* Add  `+ scale_x_log10()` and `+ geom_hline(yintercept = 1.5)` 



#### Part E. Visualise unusual causes of death {-}

We will reproduce:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/unusual-big.png")
include_graphics("tidy_case_study/unusual-sml.png")
```
<!--
<figure>
<img src="tidy_case_study/unusual-big.png" width="100%">
<img src="tidy_case_study/unusual-sml.png" width="100%">
</figure>
--> 

The first figure is the unusual causes of deaths in `devi_cod` with a relatively large number of deaths  (`n > 350`) and the second is that of a relatively small number of deaths (`n <= 350`). 

Hints

* Using the cuttoff value `resid > 1.5`, filter `devi_cod` and call it `unusual` data frame. Join `master_hod` and `unusual` data frames. Then create two subsets of data with conditions  `n > 350` and `n <= 350`.  

* Use `ggplot() + geom_line()` structure with `+ facet_warp(~ disease, ncol = 3)` 

* To include the overall hourly proportions of deaths (`prop_all`) representing the average of all causes of deaths in a given hour, add another layer by `geom_line(aes(...), data = overall_freq)` with a local `aes()` argument and a data argument. With the data argument, variables in another data frame can be combined (assuming the axes have the same measurements), and here we use the `overall_freq` data frame from the panel (d) portion of Table 16 above.  

* `last_plot() %+% another_data_frame `  reproduces a plot of the same structure with a different data frame
